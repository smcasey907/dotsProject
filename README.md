# dotsProject

This was the first major project completed in my Object Oriented Design class.

The project is based on the game dots and boxes. Each player takes turns connecting dots until a box is made. Each player that completes a box gets to take an additional turn and recieves 1 point for the completed box. This version was designed with a simple AI player that has a set order to determining where to draw its line. Input is in the form of rowcolumn rowcolumn so to connect between row a column 1 with row a column 2, input would be a1 a2.
